        <p>I'm a software engineer(Backend mainly) who is very passionate about 
            building cool software that people like using. I have professional experience 
            working with <strong>Spring boot , MySQL, Docker , Kubernetes , Grafana, 
            Prometheus, Redis , Jenkins and Karate framework</strong>.</p>
        <p>I have deep expertise in the OAuth protocol through my experience
            at Freshworks, where I have contributed in building an OAuth2.1 Authorization 
            server which is used by apps on the Freshworks marketplace to access data from
            user accounts.
        </p>    
        <p>More recently, I worked on building OIDC support to the OAuth server to provide 
            SSO support to the newly aquired on-prem software company Device42 within the 
            Freshworks ecosystem. I have gained deep understanding of Spring security and 
            the new Spring authorization server framework and the related codebases through
            these oppurtunities. 
        </p>
        <p>Outside work, I am really passionate about cars and love to read and write about them
            (You should checkout my <a href="./pages/blog.html">blog</a>!). I like running and 
            hitting the gym to fuel my mood. I enjoy watching anime and feel-good movies.
